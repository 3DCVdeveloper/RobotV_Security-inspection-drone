Security inspection drone for factory environment

We have built a quadcopter drone equipped with GPS, ultrasonic sensors, and optical flow sensors, using the Pixhawk 2.4.8 flight control board as the core control processor. It consists of three parts: motion control module, visual processing module, and positioning module. The system hardware is shown in the figure.
